# NREL Puerto Rico 100 Dataset (PR100)


## Overview

The [Puerto Rico Grid Resilience and Transitions to 100% Renewable Energy Study](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/puerto-rico-grid-resilience-and-transitions-100-renewable-energy-study-pr100) is a 2-year study by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Grid Deployment Office and six national laboratories to comprehensively analyze stakeholder-driven pathways to Puerto Rico’s clean energy future.

The PR100 dataset is a collection of geospasial data that will be useful for renewable energy development in Puerto Rico. The dataset is curated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.


## Storage resources

The data are stored in Azure Blob Storage, in the following container:

`https://nrel.blob.core.windows.net/oedi`


### Data

The data are located in the `pr100/` directory and have been categorized into 5 subdirectories:

- `Boundaries/`
- `Habitat/`
- `Hazards/`
- `Infrastructure/`
- `Topography/`


### Data format

Vector data are stored in the geoparquet format and rasters are stored as cloud-optimized geotiffs.


## Sample code

A complete Python example of accessing and visualizing some of these data is available in the accompanying [sample notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/microsoft/AIforEarthDataSets/blob/main/data/PR100.ipynb).


## Mounting the container

We also provide a read-only SAS (shared access signature) token to allow access via, e.g., [BlobFuse](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse), which allows you to mount blob containers as drives:
